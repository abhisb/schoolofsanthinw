When Santhi speaks, it reaches one’s soul and not mind. It will empower you to fully feel, understand and realize the true power of your own self and love - the actual essence of yoga.</p><div class=\"fb-quote fb_iframe_widget\" fb-xfbml-state=\"rendered\" fb-iframe-plugin-query=\"app_id=111410849575332&amp;container_width=528&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fschoolofsanthinw.herokuapp.com%2F%23&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\" style=\"display: inline-block; position: absolute; left: 164px; top: -5px;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; text-align: justify; vertical-align: bottom; width: 169px; height: 47px;\"><iframe name=\"f16e46f86af2a34\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"1000px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"fb:quote Facebook Social Plugin\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/v2.10/plugins/quote.php?app_id=111410849575332&amp;channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2Fr%2FMs1VZf1Vg1J.js%3Fversion%3D42%23cb%3Df17569708a739b4%26domain%3Dschoolofsanthinw.herokuapp.com%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fschoolofsanthinw.herokuapp.com%252Ff3257ab9bdb826%26relation%3Dparent.parent&amp;container_width=528&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fschoolofsanthinw.herokuapp.com%2F%23&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\" class=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; border-width: initial; border-style: none; visibility: visible; width: 169px; height: 47px;\"></iframe></span></div><p></p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">The world is so hallucinating that we are grabbed fully by its experience. We are often self-assured and believe that we understand everything around us. Santhi challenges our beliefs and guides us into seeing things in a different way - a way in which you start looking deeply within yourself, see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana - the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts whatsoever.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">Founded in 1992 by Master Santhi Prasad, School of Santhi focuses on improving and transforming people’s lives by disseminating the science of yoga in its entirety, blending ancient wisdom with modern thoughts.</p>","id":"a94cd4a56ec4a6a0"}
