When Santhi speaks, it reaches one’s soul and not mind. It will empower you to fully feel, understand and realize the true power of your own self and love - the actual essence of yoga.</p><div class=\"fb-quote fb_iframe_widget\" fb-xfbml-state=\"rendered\" fb-iframe-plugin-query=\"app_id=111410849575332&amp;container_width=528&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\" style=\"display: inline-block; position: absolute; left: 167.5px; top: -5px;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; text-align: justify; vertical-align: bottom; width: 169px; height: 47px;\"><iframe name=\"f1ee2e958b191f4\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"1000px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"fb:quote Facebook Social Plugin\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/v2.10/plugins/quote.php?app_id=111410849575332&amp;channel=http%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2Fr%2FMs1VZf1Vg1J.js%3Fversion%3D42%23cb%3Df3ca4d41bfec06%26domain%3Dlocalhost%26origin%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8080%252Ff170212bc9f34f4%26relation%3Dparent.parent&amp;container_width=528&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\" class=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; border-width: initial; border-style: none; visibility: visible; width: 169px; height: 47px;\"></iframe></span></div><p></p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">The world is so hallucinating that we are grabbed fully by its experience. We are often self-assured and believe that we understand everything around us. Santhi challenges our beliefs and guides us into seeing things in a different way - a way in which you start looking deeply within yourself, see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana - the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts</p>","id":"DXv2g","imageSrc":"../bin/events/DXv2g.png","isPrime":true}
