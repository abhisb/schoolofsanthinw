It is intensely remaining with one’s own real source.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">You don’t have to follow anyone to meditate. All you need is the mind to devote some time and a feeling to open your heart to the present moment. If you are ready for that, Santhi will explain what meditation is in the simplest way. Come, experience your inner self this weekend!</p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">** Entry to this workshop is absolutely free.
