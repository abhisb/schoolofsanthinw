When Santhi speaks, it reaches one’s soul and not mind.

We are often self-assured and believe that we understand everything around us. Santhi challenges our beliefs and guides us into seeing things in a different way - a way in which you start looking deeply within yourself, see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana - the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts</p>","id":"qPXJH","imageSrc":"../bin/events/qPXJH.png","isPrime":true}
